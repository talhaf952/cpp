1. When was the C programming language created?
    1972
2. Who is the creator of the C programming language?
    Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie
3. What was the original purpose behind developing C?
    The C programming language was created with the intention of writing UNIX operating systems. 
4. In which year was the first official C language specification released?
    In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language.
5. Name the programming language that heavily influenced the development of C.
     programming language B.
6. What is the significance of the "Hello, World!" program in C?
    A "Hello, World!" program is often the first written by a student of a new programming language, 
    but such a program can also be used as a sanity check to ensure that the computer software intended
    to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it.
7. Which company initially developed the C compiler?
    The initial development of the C compiler was done by Dennis Ritchie and his colleagues at Bell Laboratories (AT&T's Bell Labs) 
    in the early 1970s
8. What are the key features of the C programming language?
     The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style.
9. Explain the difference between a compiler and an interpreter in the context of C.
     A Compiler takes a program as a whole. An Interpreter takes single lines of a code. The Compilers generate intermediate machine codes.
     The Interpreters never generate any intermediate machine codes.
10. What is the role of the header file in C programming?
     header files in C serve as a means of organizing code, providing function prototypes and shared declarations, 
     promoting modularity, and facilitating code reuse.
